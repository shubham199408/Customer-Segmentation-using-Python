# Customer-Segmentation-using-Python

Customer segmentation is an effective tool for businesses to closely align their strategy and tactics with, and better target, their customers. Customer segmentation is the process by which you divide your customers up based on common characteristics â€“ such as demographics or interest, so businesses to understand their target audience.

Many unsupervised machine learning algorithms which can be used by companies to help them identify their user base and create consumer segments.

For this project we will be using K-means clustering which is an unsupervised learning technique. It uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets.

In this project, we will be focussing on Exploraotry data analysis, data pre-processing for K-mean, building a k-means clustering algorithm, performance metrics to evaluate clustering models, visualizing clusters and interpretation of cluster built.
